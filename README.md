# QA Project 2

## Introduction 
 
 For this project I have created a web application using Python and Flask, with four distinct services, one generating random numbers
 and another random letters. Those two services get requested into the backend service and generate a prize from a set prize list.
 That output gets requested and displayed by the frontend and saved into the database.
